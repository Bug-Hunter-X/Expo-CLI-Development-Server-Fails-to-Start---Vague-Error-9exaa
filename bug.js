While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the configuration of the development server.  The error message was vague, simply stating that the server failed to start without providing specific details on the cause.  I've checked the Expo CLI version, dependencies, and ensured the project's configuration files (app.json, package.json) are correctly set up. I also tried deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` folders, and reinstalling dependencies, without success. The error only appears when attempting to run the project using `expo start`.
