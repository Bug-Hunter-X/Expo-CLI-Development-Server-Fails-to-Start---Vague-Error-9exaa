# Expo CLI Development Server Failure

This repository demonstrates a problem where the Expo CLI development server fails to start, providing no useful error messages.  Despite standard troubleshooting steps (reinstalling dependencies, clearing caches), the server remains unable to launch. The bug.js file contains a sample project setup that was experiencing this issue, and bugSolution.js shows a potential workaround. The core problem appears to be related to an obscure configuration issue that is not clearly indicated by the Expo CLI.

**How to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run the project using `expo start`.
4. Observe the vague error message preventing the server from starting. 

**Potential Solution (See bugSolution.js):** The solution involves explicitly setting the development server's host and port, as well as ensuring the correct network configuration for the project.
